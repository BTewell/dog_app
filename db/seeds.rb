# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
  dog = Dog.create(name: "Chester", breed: "Dachshund", size: "small")
  dog = Dog.create(name: "Zipper", breed: "Greyhound", size: "medium")
  dog = Dog.create(name: "Zeus", breed: "Great Dane", size: "large")
